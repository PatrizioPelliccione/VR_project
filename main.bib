pages="746--790",
abstract="During software system evolution, software architects intuitively trade off the different architecture alternatives for their extra-functional properties, such as performance, maintainability, reliability, security, and usability. Researchers have proposed numerous model-driven prediction methods based on queuing networks or Petri nets, which claim to be more cost-effective and less error-prone than current practice. Practitioners are reluctant to apply these methods because of the unknown prediction accuracy and work effort. We have applied a novel model-driven prediction method called Q-ImPrESS on a large-scale process control system from ABB consisting of several million lines of code. This paper reports on the achieved performance prediction accuracy and reliability prediction sensitivity analyses as well as the effort in person hours for achieving these results.",

reinforcement learning is hard, under some formulations relatively simple solutions exist. Optimal decision thresholds for the multi-armed bandit problem, one for the infinite horizon discounted reward case and one for the finite horizon undiscounted reward case are derived, which make the link between the reward horizon, uncertainty and the need for exploration explicit. From this result follow two practical approximate algorithms related to Thompson sampling, which are illustrated experimentally.},

     abstract = {We consider a population of n projects which in general continue to evolve whether in operation or not (although by different rules). It is desired to choose the projects in operation at each instant of time so as to maximise the expected rate of reward, under a constraint upon the expected number of projects in operation. The Lagrange multiplier associated with this constraint defines an index which reduces to the Gittins index when projects not being operated are static. If one is constrained to operate m projects exactly then arguments are advanced to support the conjecture that, for m and n large in constant ratio, the policy of operating the m projects of largest current index is nearly optimal. The index is evaluated for some particular projects.},

	abstract = {Abstract. For large state-space {Markovian} Decision Problems Monte-
Carlo planning is one of the few viable approaches to and near-optimal
solutions. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, that applies
bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In inite-horizon or
discounted MDPs the algorithm is shown to be consistent and unite
sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental
results show that in several domains, UCT is signifcantly
more efficient than its alternatives.},
